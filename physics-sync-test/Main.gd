extends Node2D
## Wires everything together:
## - a Host/Join menu for manual two-window testing
## - command-line flags (--server / --client / --bot) for automated,
##   headless testing (no windows, no keyboard needed)
## - player spawning via MultiplayerSpawner
## - a simple on-screen debug readout of the crate's synced state
##
## NOTE on spawning: an earlier version of this file spawned players by hand
## with a custom RPC. That raced against the crate/player state-sync packets:
## those are sent UNRELIABLE (for speed), while a hand-written spawn RPC is
## RELIABLE, and ENet gives no ordering guarantee between packets sent on
## different channels/reliability modes. So a client could receive "player 1
## is at (x,y)" before it had even created player 1's node — "Node not
## found" errors. MultiplayerSpawner is Godot's built-in fix for exactly
## this: it guarantees a node is spawned locally before any sync data for it
## is processed, on every peer, including peers that join late.
